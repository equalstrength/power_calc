### What is this?

This app calculates the expected power based on simulations with different sample sizes.  

### Simulation settings

**Number of simulations:** Total number of iterations over random outcomes.  
A higher number of simulations increases precision but takes longer to run.  

**Alpha:** The level under which the p-value will indicate if the interaction is statistically significant. 

**Min. sample size:** The smallest sample size to be included in the simulations.  
**Max. sample size:** The largest sample size to be included in the simulations.   
In "Additional settings", it is possible to indicate the number of sample sizes to be included in the calculation. 
The default is 50. 
  
  
### Parameters

**Baseline call-back rate:** The expected proportion of successful callbacks for the majority group.  
Meta-analyses () indicate that this value tends to vary from...

#### Effect sizes

**Main treat. (X1):** The expected effect size of being in a minority group.
Values tend to vary from...  

**Second treat. (X2):** The expected effect size for gender (or parental status/partner).
Values tend to vary from...  

**Interact. (all treatments):** The expected effect size of the interaction between all treatments.
In "Additional settings" it is possible to determine 

### Additional settings

**Number of samples**: The total number of sample sizes that will be included between the minimum and maximum sample sizes.
